    About Machine Learning Model on Customerâ€™s Churn Prediction
  </h2>
  <p>
    The aim of the project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts
    customer churn, addressing the challenge businesses face in retaining
    customers. Customer churn, where customers discontinue their relationship
    with a business, impacts revenue and growth. By leveraging machine learning,
    businesses can identify customers likely to churn and implement proactive
    retention strategies. The project addresses the complexities of churn
    prediction, emphasizing the importance of customer relationship management.
